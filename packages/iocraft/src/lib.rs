//! # iocraft
//!
//! `iocraft` is a library for crafting beautiful text output and interfaces for the terminal or
//! logs. It allows you to easily build complex layouts and interactive elements using a
//! declarative API.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - Define your UI using a clean, highly readable syntax.
//! - Organize your UI using flexbox layouts powered by [`taffy`](https://docs.rs/taffy/).
//! - Output colored and styled UIs to the terminal or ASCII output anywhere else.
//! - Create animated or interactive elements with event handling and hooks.
//! - Build fullscreen terminal applications with ease.
//! - Pass [props](crate::Props) and [context](crate::components::ContextProvider) by reference to avoid unnecessary cloning.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! If you're familiar with React, you'll feel right at home with `iocraft`. It uses all the same
//! concepts, but is text-focused and made for Rust.
//!
//! Here's your first `iocraft` program:
//!
//! ```
//! use iocraft::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     element! {
//!         View(
//!             border_style: BorderStyle::Round,
//!             border_color: Color::Blue,
//!         ) {
//!             Text(content: "Hello, world!")
//!         }
//!     }
//!     .print();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Your UI is composed primarily via the [`element!`] macro, which allows you to declare your UI
//! elements in a React/SwiftUI-like syntax.
//!
//! `iocraft` provides a few built-in components in the [`components`] module, such as
//! [`View`](crate::components::View), [`Text`](crate::components::Text), and
//! [`TextInput`](crate::components::TextInput), but you can also create your own using the
//! [`macro@component`] macro.
//!
//! For example, here's a custom component that uses a [hook](crate::hooks) to display a counter
//! which increments every 100ms:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use iocraft::prelude::*;
//! # use std::time::Duration;
//! #[component]
//! fn Counter(mut hooks: Hooks) -> impl Into<AnyElement<'static>> {
//!     let mut count = hooks.use_state(|| 0);
//!
//!     hooks.use_future(async move {
//!         loop {
//!             smol::Timer::after(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
//!             count += 1;
//!         }
//!     });
//!
//!     element! {
//!         Text(color: Color::Blue, content: format!("counter: {}", count))
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## More Examples
//!
//! There are many [examples on GitHub](https://github.com/ccbrown/iocraft/tree/main/examples)
//! which demonstrate various concepts such as tables, progress bars, full screen apps, forms, and
//! more!.
//!
//! ## Shoutouts
//!
//! `iocraft` was inspired by [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) and
//! [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink), which you should also check out, especially if
//! you're building graphical interfaces or interested in using JavaScript/TypeScript.
//!
//! You may also want to check out [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui), which serves a
//! similar purpose with a less declarative API.

// # Organization
//
// Code is organized into modules primarily for the benefit of the maintainers. Types will be
// re-exported in the root so that users of the library have a flat namespace to work with.
//
// The exception is the modules that represent collections of types, namely hooks and components.
// Those types will remain in their modules for the public API.
