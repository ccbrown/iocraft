//! # iocraft
//!
//! `iocraft` is a library for crafting beautiful text output and interfaces for the terminal or
//! logs. It allows you to easily build complex layouts and interactive elements using a
//! declarative API.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - Define your UI using a clean, highly readable syntax.
//! - Organize your UI using flexbox layouts powered by [`taffy`](https://docs.rs/taffy/).
//! - Output colored and styled UIs to the terminal or ASCII output anywhere else.
//! - Create animated or interactive elements with event handling and hooks.
//! - Build fullscreen terminal applications with ease.
//! - Pass [props](crate::Props) and [context](crate::components::ContextProvider) by reference to avoid unnecessary cloning.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! If you're familiar with React, you'll feel right at home with `iocraft`. It uses all the same
//! concepts, but is text-focused and made for Rust.
//!
//! Here's your first `iocraft` program:
//!
//! ```
//! use iocraft::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     element! {
//!         View(
//!             border_style: BorderStyle::Round,
//!             border_color: Color::Blue,
//!         ) {
//!             Text(content: "Hello, world!")
//!         }
//!     }
//!     .print();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Your UI is composed primarily via the [`element!`] macro, which allows you to declare your UI
//! elements in a React/SwiftUI-like syntax.
//!
//! `iocraft` provides a few built-in components in the [`components`] module, such as
//! [`View`](crate::components::View), [`Text`](crate::components::Text), and
//! [`TextInput`](crate::components::TextInput), but you can also create your own using the
//! [`macro@component`] macro.
//!
//! For example, here's a custom component that uses a [hook](crate::hooks) to display a counter
//! which increments every 100ms:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use iocraft::prelude::*;
//! # use std::time::Duration;
//! #[component]
//! fn Counter(mut hooks: Hooks) -> impl Into<AnyElement<'static>> {
//!     let mut count = hooks.use_state(|| 0);
//!
//!     hooks.use_future(async move {
//!         loop {
//!             smol::Timer::after(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
//!             count += 1;
//!         }
//!     });
//!
//!     element! {
//!         Text(color: Color::Blue, content: format!("counter: {}", count))
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## More Examples
//!
//! There are many [examples on GitHub](https://github.com/ccbrown/iocraft/tree/main/examples)
//! which demonstrate various concepts such as tables, progress bars, full screen apps, forms, and
//! more!.
//!
//! ## Shoutouts
//!
//! `iocraft` was inspired by [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) and
//! [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink), which you should also check out, especially if
//! you're building graphical interfaces or interested in using JavaScript/TypeScript.
//!
//! You may also want to check out [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui), which serves a
//! similar purpose with a less declarative API.

// # Organization
//
// Code is organized into modules primarily for the benefit of the maintainers. Types will be
// re-exported in the root so that users of the library have a flat namespace to work with.
//
// The exception is the modules that represent collections of types, namely hooks and components.
// Those types will remain in their modules for the public API.

    /// Used to declare an element and its properties.
    ///
    /// Elements are declared starting with their type. All properties are optional, so the simplest
    /// use of this macro is just a type name:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # use iocraft::prelude::*;
    /// # fn my_element() -> Element<'static, View> {
    /// element!(View)
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// This will evaluate to an [`Element`]`<'static, `[`View`](crate::components::View)`>` with no properties set.
    ///
    /// To specify properties, you can add them in a parenthesized block after the type name:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # use iocraft::prelude::*;
    /// # fn my_element() -> Element<'static, View> {
    /// element! {
    ///     View(width: 80, height: 24, background_color: Color::Green)
    /// }
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// If the element has a `children` property, you can pass one or more child elements in braces like so:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # use iocraft::prelude::*;
    /// # fn my_element() -> Element<'static, View> {
    /// element! {
    ///     View {
    ///         Text(content: "Hello, world!")
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Lastly, you can use Rust to conditionally add child elements via `#()` blocks that evaluate
    /// to any iterator type:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # use iocraft::prelude::*;
    /// # fn my_element(show_greeting: bool) -> Element<'static, View> {
    /// element! {
    ///     View {
    ///         #(if show_greeting {
    ///             Some(element! {
    ///                 Text(content: "Hello, world!")
    ///             })
    ///         } else {
    ///             None
    ///         })
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// If you're rendering a dynamic UI, you will want to ensure that when adding multiple
    /// elements via an iterator a unique key is specified for each one. Otherwise, the elements

    /// property, which can be given to any element:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # use iocraft::prelude::*;
    /// # struct User { id: i32, name: String }
    /// # fn my_element(users: Vec<User>) -> Element<'static, View> {
    /// element! {
    ///     View {
    ///         #(users.iter().map(|user| element! {
    ///             View(key: user.id, flex_direction: FlexDirection::Column) {
    ///                 Text(content: format!("Hello, {}!", user.name))
    ///             }
    ///         }))
    ///     }
    /// }
