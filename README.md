`iocraft` is a library for crafting beautiful text output and interfaces for the terminal or
logs. It allows you to easily build complex layouts and interactive elements using a
declarative API.

## Features

- Define your UI using a clean, highly readable syntax.
- Organize your UI using flexbox layouts powered by [`taffy`](https://docs.rs/taffy/).
- Output colored and styled UIs to the terminal or ASCII output anywhere else.
- Create animated or interactive elements with event handling and hooks.
- Build fullscreen terminal applications with ease.
- Pass props and context by reference to avoid unnecessary cloning.
- Broad support for both Unix and Windows terminals so your UIs look great everywhere.

## Getting Started

If you're familiar with React, you'll feel right at home with `iocraft`. It uses all the same
concepts, but is text-focused and made for Rust.

Here's your first `iocraft` program:

```rust
use iocraft::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    element! {
        View(
            border_style: BorderStyle::Round,
            border_color: Color::Blue,
        ) {
            Text(content: "Hello, world!")
        }
    }
    .print();
}
```

Your UI is composed primarily via the `element!` macro, which allows you to
declare your UI elements in a React/SwiftUI-like syntax.

`iocraft` provides a few built-in components, such as `View`, `Text`, and
`TextInput`, but you can also create your own using the `#[component]` macro.

For example, here's a custom component that uses a hook to display a counter
which increments every 100ms:

```rust
use iocraft::prelude::*;
use std::time::Duration;

#[component]
fn Counter(mut hooks: Hooks) -> impl Into<AnyElement<'static>> {
    let mut count = hooks.use_state(|| 0);

    hooks.use_future(async move {
        loop {
            smol::Timer::after(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
            count += 1;
        }
    });

    element! {
        Text(color: Color::Blue, content: format!("counter: {}", count))
    }
}

fn main() {
    smol::block_on(element!(Counter).render_loop()).unwrap();
}
```

## More Examples

There are many [examples on GitHub](https://github.com/ccbrown/iocraft/tree/main/examples) which
demonstrate various concepts such as tables, progress bars, fullscreen apps,
forms, and more!

## Shoutouts

`iocraft` was inspired by [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) and
[Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink), which you should also check out,
especially if you're building graphical interfaces or interested in using
JavaScript/TypeScript.

You may also want to check out [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui),
which serves a similar purpose with a less declarative API.
