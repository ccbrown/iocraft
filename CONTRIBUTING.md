# Welcome to the iocraft contributing guide!

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the project!

Pull requests for bug fixes and feature contributions are greatly appreciated!

## If you've found a bug that you'd like to fix...

Please search the issues first to see if it's a known issue or if there's any relevant discussion.

If the fix would require a large time investment or would have a significant impact on the crate's API, please use an existing or new issue to propose your fix before you begin.

## If you'd like to implement a new feature...

Again, please search the issues first to see if there's any relevant discussion.

If the feature is minor or quick to implement, you can feel free to open a pull request right away. If the feature is more invasive or requires significant investment, start a discussion about it via an issue so we can make sure we're aligned on the right direction to take.

## Thank you!

❤️❤️❤️
